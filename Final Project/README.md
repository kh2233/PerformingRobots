Final Project

One robot is a worker robot on the assembly line and another "capitalist" robot is telling the worker robot what to do
faster and faster until the worker starts to fall apart. The audience will decide if the worker should kill the "capitalist"
robot.

Greatest risk or uncertainty:

Ideally we would like the worker robot to be stamping multiple pieces of paper, like a postcard. 
To do this we need to figure out how to balance enough weight to create a stamp on the arm, while ensuring that 
it is not too heavy to be lifted by the motors.

Detailed parts list:

Worker Robot

1.Body made out of paper(?) 
2.black and white Paper mach√© / plaster face 
3.Stepper motor for turning body (need stronger motors) 
4.Stepper motor lifting arm (need stronger motors) 
5.Motor shield 6.Arduino uno 
7.Bluetooth module (for manual override) 
8.String/wire to pull the hand up

"Capitalist" Robot

1.Manaquin body 
2.Cloth head

Clock

1.White paper 
2.Black paper for clock hands 
3.Arduino

Outline of programs

"Worker" Robot

lift stamp 
turn right 35 degrees 
put stamp in ink 
lift stamp 
turn left 70 degrees 
stamp 
turn right 70 degrees

"Capitalist" Robot

will only speak and have a projection

Clock

start motor 
move forward with manual commands (bluetooth),
move faster

We have changed our interactive element. We were going to have the audience vote on wether or not the worker robot should 
kill the one who was order it around, but have instead decided to create a 'fake' voting system instead to ensrue that 
the results are yes and that the robot it killed.
