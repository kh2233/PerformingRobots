Final Project

One robot is a worker robot on the assembly line and another "capitalist" robot is telling the worker robot what to do
faster and faster until the worker starts to fall apart. The audience will decide if the worker should kill the "capitalist"
robot.

Greatest risk or uncertainty:

Ideally we would like the worker robot to be stamping multiple pieces of paper, like a postcard. 
To do this we need to figure out how to balance enough weight to create a stamp on the arm, while ensuring that 
it is not too heavy to be lifted by the motors.

Detailed parts list:

Worker Robot

1.Body made out of paper(?) 
2.black and white Paper mach√© / plaster face 
3.Stepper motor for turning body (need stronger motors) 
4.Stepper motor lifting arm (need stronger motors) 
5.Motor shield 6.Arduino uno 
7.Bluetooth module (for manual override) 
8.String/wire to pull the hand up

"Capitalist" Robot

1.Manaquin body 
2.Cloth head

Clock

1.White paper 
2.Black paper for clock hands 
3.Arduino

move forward with manual commands (bluetooth),
move faster

We have changed our interactive element. We were going to have the audience vote on wether or not the worker robot should 
kill the one who was order it around, but have instead decided to create a 'fake' voting system instead to ensrue that 
the results are yes and that the robot it killed.

Final Project Documentation

Concept: We wanted to portray a worker robot, doing a repetative task and decided that a stapping motion would work the best for that. The robotic arm was program to do two stamps before having a pause. The other main robot was the conveyer belt. The conveyer doesn't really have a personality as we just wanted to create the environment to stage to robotic arm. 

Materials: We decided use mainly wood and acrylic to create sturdy robots. This proved to be a challange as we had never really worked with these tools before, and sometimes what we would test with card board for a prototype would not work with our perferred material. Knowing the challenges we faced, I wish we had gotten training on how to use the power tools so we could properly work with the materials and equipment. I believe if we learned a bit more about working with acrylic or wood or metal we would have been more confident in using the materials, but I do not think I would chose to use a different material all together as it did make for a more robust robot.

Challenges: We had to learn how to use new power tools that we were not very familiar with beforehand, whether it was through going to the woodshop, looking online, or asking for help. Actually making a moving arm was very difficult. We had tried different techniques and some worked fine with cardboard because of how forgiving the material can be, but did not work as well with wood and acrylic. Another challenge was collaborating with Software Art + Text. It was hard to solidify our ideas, especially since I was in a group of three, sometimes two would talk and forget to tell the other one, and we were constantly trying to make sure that everyone as on the same page. Even though we spend the second half of the semester working on our robots, it could be hard with collaboration as it felt as if I was so far behind compared to my partner in Software Art + Text, although I know it is purely because it takes more time to physically build and code something.
