# PerformingRobots

This is a video of a 'kinetic sculpture' (in the words of the creator) that plays the violin. I found it intersting because I have previously seen videos of self-paying instruments but they didn't use the same techniques that humans use to play them. There aren't many comments on the video, but one of them pointed out that they didn't understand the need for people to create robots for creative activites such as making music as it lacks the human emotion that people tend to feel with music. I thought this was an intersting perspective and would like to discuss more about the postion that robots do play in creative environments.






Robots and Gender

I remember near the beginning of building our first robots that a lot of us were refering to our robots as people, and I 
belive that most of us viewed our robots as male and used masculine pronouns. I found an article about how people view 
ambiguous robots when assigning genders to them. I thought it was an intersting read so I decided to share the article!

Final Project Ideas

https://arsandbox.ucdavis.edu/

Building off Brooke's idea with projecting onto sand, I found a proejct that had a similar concept the projected topogrophy onto sand. People can move the sand around to change the map, creating mountains and lakes etc.. While this project includeds AR, we do want to include a similar aspect of touch. 



FINAL PROJECT 
My group hasn't completed decided on what we want our final project to be since we had to change our idea due to the new constraints. We, ideally, would like to keep our idea of incorporating death, similar to our orginal idea. 

Puppet show of robots?

Areas of greatest risk or uncertainty:
  
Mechanical:
-Three robots acting out a story similar to a puppet show, need to ensure that they are sturdy enough
-Need to create breathing mechanism for the dying robot/robot on the wall(FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE BREATHING MECHANISM)

Electronics:
-Arduino Uno (Three, one for each robot)
-Adafruit Bluetooth
-Light sensors
-PCB Board 
-Microphones?

Software:
-Program actions and paths into our actor robots
-Software text to create illusion that actors are speaking
-Networking with audience for end of performance 

Power:
-Powered by batteries

Parts list:
-Arduino Uno (Three, one for each robot)
-Adafruit Bluetooth or XBee
-Wood
-Paint
-metal?
-Light sensors
-PCB Board 
-Microphones?
-Plaster
-Maybe vacuum pump, or if that is too complicated, use a servo motor
