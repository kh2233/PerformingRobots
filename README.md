# PerformingRobots

This is a video of a 'kinetic sculpture' (in the words of the creator) that plays the violin. I found it intersting because I have previously seen videos of self-paying instruments but they didn't use the same techniques that humans use to play them. There aren't many comments on the video, but one of them pointed out that they didn't understand the need for people to create robots for creative activites such as making music as it lacks the human emotion that people tend to feel with music. I thought this was an intersting perspective and would like to discuss more about the postion that robots do play in creative environments.






Robots and Gender

I remember near the beginning of building our first robots that a lot of us were refering to our robots as people, and I 
belive that most of us viewed our robots as male and used masculine pronouns. I found an article about how people view 
ambiguous robots when assigning genders to them. I thought it was an intersting read so I decided to share the article!

Final Project Ideas

https://arsandbox.ucdavis.edu/

Building off Brooke's idea with projecting onto sand, I found a proejct that had a similar concept the projected topogrophy onto sand. People can move the sand around to change the map, creating mountains and lakes etc.. While this project includeds AR, we do want to include a similar aspect of touch.
