This is a video of a 'kinetic sculpture' (in the words of the creator) that plays the violin. I found it intersting because I have previously seen videos of self-paying instruments but they didn't use the same techniques that humans use to play them. There aren't many comments on the video, but one of them pointed out that they didn't understand the need for people to create robots for creative activites such as making music as it lacks the human emotion that people tend to feel with music. I thought this was an intersting perspective and would like to discuss more about the postion that robots do play in creative environments.
