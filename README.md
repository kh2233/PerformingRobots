This is a video of a 'kinetic sculpture' (in the words of the creator) that plays the violin. I found it intersting because I have previously seen videos of self-paying instruments but they didn't use the same techniques that humans use to play them. There aren't many comments on the video, but one of them pointed out that they didn't understand the need for people to create robots for creative activites such as making music as it lacks the human emotion that people tend to feel with music. I thought this was an intersting perspective and would like to discuss more about the postion that robots do play in creative environments.






Robots and Gender

I remember near the beginning of building our first robots that a lot of us were refering to our robots as people, and I 
belive that most of us viewed our robots as male and used masculine pronouns. I found an article about how people view 
ambiguous robots when assigning genders to them. I thought it was an intersting read so I decided to share the article!

Final Project Ideas

https://arsandbox.ucdavis.edu/

Building off Brooke's idea with projecting onto sand, I found a proejct that had a similar concept the projected topogrophy onto sand. People can move the sand around to change the map, creating mountains and lakes etc.. While this project includeds AR, we do want to include a similar aspect of touch. 






FINAL PROJECT 


My group hasn't completed decided on what we want our final project to be since we had to change our idea due to the new constraints. We, ideally, would like to keep our idea of incorporating death, similar to our orginal idea. 

Puppet show of robots?

Areas of greatest risk or uncertainty:
  
Mechanical:
-Three robots acting out a story similar to a puppet show, need to ensure that they are sturdy enough
-Need to create breathing mechanism for the dying robot/robot on the wall(FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE BREATHING MECHANISM)

Electronics:
-Arduino Uno (Three, one for each robot)
-Adafruit Bluetooth
-Light sensors
-PCB Board 
-Microphones?

Software:
-Program actions and paths into our actor robots
-Software text to create illusion that actors are speaking
-Networking with audience for end of performance 

Power:
-Powered by batteries

Parts list:
-Arduino Uno (Three, one for each robot)
-Adafruit Bluetooth or XBee
-Wood
-Paint
-metal?
-Light sensors
-PCB Board 
-Microphones?
-Plaster
-Maybe vacuum pump, or if that is too complicated, use a servo motor 

Schedule:

Tuesday 11/14/17
- Finalize performance idea; puppet show of robots?
- Start creating prototype

Thursday 11/16/17
- Finish working on prototype
- Rework idea/ Make sure that we want to pursue this idea based on prototype
- Start looking for storylines/ Brainstorm ideas

Tuesday 11/21/17
-Continue looking for story ideas
-Review protype and finalize the style and mechanical choices we should change/implement for the final 

Thursday 11/23/17 
- Start creating the final version of robots

Satruday 11/25/17
- Continue building robots

Tuesday 11/28/17
- Continue building robots

Final Project

One robot is a worker robot on the assembly line and another "capitalist" robot is telling the worker robot what to d,o faster and faster until the worker starts to fall apart. The audience will decide if the worker should kill the "capitalist" robot.

Greatest risk or uncertainty:

Ideally we would like the worker robot to be stamping multiple pieces of paper, like a postcard. To do this we need to figure out how to balance enough weight to create a stamp on the arm, while ensuring that it is not too heavy to be lifted by the motors.

Detailed parts list:

Worker Robot

1.Body made out of paper(?)
2.black and white Paper mach√© / plaster face
3.Stepper motor for turning body (need stronger motors)
4.Stepper motor lifting arm (need stronger motors)
5.Motor shield
6.Arduino uno 
7.Bluetooth module (for manual override)
8.String/wire to pull the hand up

"Capitalist" Robot

1.Manaquin body
2.Cloth head

Clock

1.White paper
2.Black paper for clock hands
3.Arduino 


Hand drawn sketch


Block diagram of the electronics

Outline of programs

"Worker" Robot

lift stamp
turn right 35 degrees
put stamp in ink
lift stamp
turn left 70 degrees
stamp
turn right 70 degrees

"Capitalist" Robot

will only speak and have a projection

Clock

start motor
move forward
with manual commands (bluetooth), move faster


We have changed our interactive element. We were going to have the audience vote on wether or not the worker robot should kill the one who was order it around, but have instead decided to create a 'fake' voting system instead to ensrue that the results are yes and that the robot it killed.
